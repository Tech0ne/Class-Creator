## What is it ?

This tool helps generating classes from student list.

You probably don't need it if you are not in charge of this type of work.

## How it works ?

Class-Creator generate classes using various inputs :

- A list of all the students, with every caracteristics, including languages and other

- A list of paterns (like : "In the first class, I want 15 peoples learning Italian, and 15 peoples learning Spanish.")

Next-up, it will process these infos, and return a semi-randomly generated list of every classes with every student.

The random seed will also be given, to make a "hash" of your generated list.
